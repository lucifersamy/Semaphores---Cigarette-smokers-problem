# Semaphores---Cigarette-smokers-problem
CSE344 â€“ System Programming - Homework #3 - preparing a small bakers simulation inspired by a classic synchronization problem cigarette smokers problem. One with named semaphores and one with unnamed semaphores.

shortcoming: poor synchronization(using sleep), error handling could be smoother (cleaning all resources on every exit)
